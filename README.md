This project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations using various data analysis techniques. The primary focus is on optimizing the F1-score for the 'canceled' class (class '1'). A high F1-score for this class is critical for balancing the costs associated with false negatives (overbooking due to expected cancellations that do not happen) and false positives (predicting cancellations when the guest actually arrives). By improving prediction accuracy, the hotel can better manage room availability and enhance customer satisfaction.
